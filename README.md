# 🏏 IPL Pulse Dashboard

A high-fidelity, modern web application designed for cricket fans. **IPL Pulse** is a real-time IPL (Indian Premier League) dashboard that combines live match statistics, an interactive AI chatbot, and a competitive prediction game into a single, beautiful "glassmorphism" bento-grid layout.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Fully Responsive:** The 3-column dashboard flawlessly collapses into vertical stacks, ensuring a perfect viewing experience on mobile devices and tablets.
*   **Live Match State Engine:** Displays dynamic data including the current score, run rate, active striker/non-striker statistics, and current bowler metrics.

*   **Prediction Game:** Features a live betting/prediction module connected to **Firebase Authentication**. Users can sign up, log in, predict next-over runs or wicket methods, and track their leaderboard points.
*   **Reliable Asset Management:** Utilizes locally hosted, high-quality SVG vector graphics to ensure team logos load instantly without CORS or ad-blocker interference.
